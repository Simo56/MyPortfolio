title: Crypto Novus Racing
description: CryptoNovusRacing, an Ethereum Smart Contract developed in Solidity 0.8.0. This cutting-edge contract produces one-of-a-kind NFT cars with randomized elements, delivering a unique collectible journey. Offering dynamic creation, customizable costs, transparent ownership tracking, and IPFS integration for metadata storage, the project ensures a seamless user experience. As the founder, I've implemented features for contract customization and secure fund withdrawal. The accompanying DApp, developed by myself with Web3.js, enables users to effortlessly mint and showcase their distinctive NFT cars on the Ethereum blockchain.
