title: APT-TS
description: APT (Automated Penetration Testing) is a suite of tools (currently including nmap and Metasploit) that collaborates to assist ethical hackers in their roles. It is a robust solution developed with Node.js and TypeScript, working in conjunction with Express. This suite automates various penetration testing tasks, from gathering OSINT information on the target to scanning the victim and ultimately searching for possible exploits based on the vulnerability scan of the host. This process streamlines the evaluation of system and application security.
