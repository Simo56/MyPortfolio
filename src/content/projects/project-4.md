title: AST-iPyNB
description: malware detector using a feedforward neural network implemented with scikit-learn. The detector is designed to classify PE Files as either benign or containing malware.
It includes this features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes data loading, splitting, and scaling for effective model training.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the neural network.
Scalable and Configurable: Easily adjust the architecture and parameters of the neural network for experimentation.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy and classification report on validation set for model evaluation.
