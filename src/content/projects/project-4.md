description: malware detector using a feedforward neural network implemented with scikit-learn. The detector is designed to classify PE Files as either benign or containing malware.It includes the following features - Data Preprocessing - Includes data loading, splitting, and scaling for effective model training. - Hyperparameter Tuning - Utilizes GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters for the neural network. - Evaluation Metrics-  Provides accuracy and classification report on validation set for model evaluation. - Scalable and Configurable - Easily adjust the architecture and parameters of the neural network for experimentation.
